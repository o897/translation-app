# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

User Stories
By default, it should translate 'Hello, how are you' to French.
Users can copy the translating and translated texts.
Users can have the option to listen to the translating and translated texts.
Users can see the translated text after selecting the Translate button. Optionally, users can see updates in real-time and you use debounce or throttling to optimize the application.
